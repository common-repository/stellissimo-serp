== Description ==

Stellissimo SERP

Automatically check the first 10 websites in Google SERP (search engine results pages) for a given keyword and language, displaying the Bing rank too. 

This plugin reads the results from Google and Bing and stores the data into a .txt file that is a sort of cache to prevent search engines' banning.
The results are displayed into a widget with a customizable table (a better design will come soon).
This simple rank checker was originally developed for the website  [stellissimo](http://www.stellissimo.eu/) for a game, but we decided to publish and improve it in the future.
